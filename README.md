# Covid-Tracker

Covid-19 Tracker using React.
The app uses react, material ui and chart.js. 

Consumers the apis available at https://disease.sh/docs/


## Usage 
1. Download project folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Check if all dependencies are installed or install the missing dependecies (I might have missed using the --save flag while doing npm installs)
4. Run `npm start`


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Note
  Ensure the api is still functional, I will try to maintain the repositories but forgive if I don't maintain it regulary. 
  Please fell free to use the project and make changes to it.
